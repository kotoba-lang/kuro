;; Drift guard for the vendored kotoba.lang.text shim (see commit e4da1c2 / #110).
;;
;; deps.edn pins io.github.kotoba-lang/text at sha 73bdb13ae7a3d004b44bca08be03a3191157a38f;
;; nbb reads none of tools.deps, so the exact pinned source is vendored under
;; test/cljs-shims/kotoba/lang/text.cljc and both nbb suites load it. A vendored
;; copy is a fork the moment someone edits it: the JVM then runs the pinned
;; kotoba.lang.text while parity/host run a different one, and test:parity —
;; the gate whose entire purpose is "the same code on both runtimes" — stays
;; green while comparing two different libraries.
;;
;; This guard makes the vendored file's sha256 a pinned claim. CI does not have
;; network access to re-fetch the gitlib, so the expectation is the recorded
;; sha of the file AS PINNED (verified locally against
;; ~/.gitlibs/.../text/73bdb13.../src/kotoba/lang/text.cljc — byte-identical;
;; git hash-object of both is e269697f6d5e98afb83e7e5d613545f80f432719).
;; Updating the pin in deps.edn REQUIRES updating this file in the same PR:
;; touch one without the other and a suite goes red on purpose.
