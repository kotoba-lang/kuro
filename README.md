# kuro

`kuro` is the Kotoba **terminal** model for [`kobo`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kobo)
— the interactive terminal / console layer of the Kotoba workbench
(ADR-2606301000). If you are looking for a terminal, a console, a shell
session, a TTY surface, or command execution with an audit trail in this
workspace, this is the repository. The name carries none of that, which is why
this paragraph does.

`kuro.terminal` is portable Clojure/ClojureScript (`.cljc`) and contains no
direct shell, PTY, filesystem, network, thread, or clock access. A host
provides those effects; `kuro` defines the data contract that makes terminal
sessions auditable.

```text
kuro = terminal session + command intent + effective grant + receipt
```

**Status: R2** — the model is stable and a real backing runs commands with
streaming output, stdin and cancellation. Not a PTY (see *Not a PTY* below).

## Model

Terminal modes are explicit:

| mode | purpose |
|---|---|
| `:terminal-repo` | default grant: repo read, tmp write, no secrets |
| `:terminal-build` | build grant: repo read/write, cache, bounded net |
| `:terminal-agent` | durable agent tick terminal |
| `:terminal-host` | signed opt-in escape hatch |

The host may implement the backing with a local sandbox, container, microVM, or
aiueos surface provider. `kuro.terminal` only records the intent and verifies
the portable shape.

A receipt is uniformly `:kuro/*`. Host-supplied result keys are namespaced on
the way in and keys outside the declared set are dropped, so one host cannot
widen the shape another host will not produce.

## Example

```clojure
(require '[kuro.terminal :as t])

(def session
  (t/session "s1" "repo-cid" :terminal-repo
             {:kuro/cwd "."
              :kuro/grant {:capabilities #{"repo/read" "tmp/write"}}}))

(def cmd (t/command ["clojure" "-M:test"]))

(t/receipt session cmd {:exit-code 0 :stdout "ok\n" :stderr ""})
```

## Running commands for real — `kuro.host.node`

`kuro.host.node` is the Node (nbb) host provider for one-shot commands. It is ClojureScript, not `.cljc`, because the effect belongs to
the host and the model stays portable without it.

```clojure
(require '[kuro.host.node :as host])

(host/run session (t/command ["git" "status" "--short"]) {:repo-root "."})
;; => {:kuro/type :kuro/receipt :kuro/exit-code 0
;;     :kuro/stdout "…" :kuro/stdout-cid "bafkrei…" :kuro/duration-ms 41 …}
```

### What it enforces

| guarantee | mechanism |
|---|---|
| denial before execution | missing capability ⇒ denial map, no spawn |
| no shell interpolation | argv vector, `:shell false` |
| cwd confinement | resolved path must stay under the repo root |
| no ambient environment | the child env is the declared manifest; `process.env` is never passed |
| bounded time | `:timeout-ms`, default 120 s ⇒ exit 124, `:kuro/timed-out?` |
| bounded output | `:max-output-bytes`, default 1 MiB ⇒ exit 125, `:kuro/truncated?` |
| content-addressed output | stdout/stderr as CIDv1-raw/sha2-256 (`bafkrei…`) |

### The mode is a grant scope, not an isolation level

The default mode is `:terminal-repo`, not `terminal-safe`. It was renamed on
2026-08-04 because nothing here confines the filesystem or the network, and
"safe" was the one word in the vocabulary claiming otherwise — read by an
operator deciding what to run.

Every receipt carries `:kuro/isolation`, defaulting to `:none`. A host that
really confines (container, microVM, aiueos surface provider) puts its own
value there. **A receipt that omits it would be read as though it had been
isolated**, so it is never omitted.

### What it does not enforce

A capability set is an **intent record, not a kernel.** This provider does not
confine filesystem writes, does not block network access, and does not isolate
the process namespace. A command granted only `repo/read` can still write to
disk; nothing stops it but the receipt saying it should not have.

That is the documented split — the backing may be a sandbox, container, microVM,
or aiueos surface provider. This is the smallest honest backing: enough to
produce real receipts from real commands, not enough to run untrusted code.
`:terminal-host` has no backing here at all and is refused.

One measured caveat: on macOS, CoreFoundation injects
`__CF_USER_TEXT_ENCODING` into every child below the spawn API. The manifest is
everything this provider passes, not literally everything the child sees.

## Streaming, stdin, cancellation — `kuro.host.stream-node`

`run` is synchronous: it returns only when the command is over, which makes a
ten-minute build and an infinite loop look identical to the caller. The
streaming provider fixes that.

```clojure
(require '[kuro.host.stream-node :as sh])

(def h (sh/start session (t/command ["npm" "test"])
                 {:repo-root "."
                  :on-chunk (fn [st chunk] (print (:text chunk)))
                  :on-exit  (fn [receipt] ...)}))

((:write h) "y\n")      ; stdin
((:close-stdin h))
((:kill h))              ; SIGTERM
@(:stream h)             ; the live kuro.stream value, readable at any moment
```

`sh/run-async` wraps it in a Promise resolving to the receipt.

The same guarantees apply — capability check before spawn, argv with no shell,
cwd confinement, declared environment, deadline, output cap. The cap is
enforced across **both** streams together by `kuro.stream`, which also records
how many bytes it dropped: a silently-cut receipt is indistinguishable from a
short success.

## Surviving the host — `kuro.checkpoint`

A `kuro.stream` value lives only in memory: if the host dies, both *what was
running* and *how far it got* die with it. `kobo.agent`'s durable loop cannot
sit on that.

```clojure
(require '[kuro.checkpoint :as cp])

(cp/->edn @(:stream h))                  ; a plain EDN value — write it anywhere
(cp/restore saved)                       ; back, as a stream
```

Pure `.cljc`: this namespace converts, it does not persist. **Writing is the
host's job**, so the choice of file / kotobase / DataLad does not reach here.

Two things it refuses to pretend:

- **A restored run is never `:running`.** Its process did not survive the
  host, so it comes back `:orphaned` (with `:kuro/restored-from` keeping what
  it was). Returning `:running` would invite the caller to send stdin to a
  corpse.
- **`cp/abandon` closes an orphan into a receipt** — exit 129 and a stated
  reason by default, or whatever the host actually knows. A run that cannot be
  closed leaves an open hole in the ledger.

`:max-chunk-bytes` truncates the saved body and records
`:kuro.checkpoint/dropped-bytes`; the byte counters keep the pre-truncation
truth. Off by default — capping is the storage's business, not this layer's.

## Reading real output — ANSI escape sequences (`kuro.ansi`)

Command output is not plain text. `kuro.ansi` turns it into styled lines.

```clojure
(ansi/lines "\u001b[32mok\u001b[0m\nnext")
;; => [[{:text "ok" :style {:fg "green"}}] [{:text "next" :style {}}]]
```

Handled: SGR (bold/dim/italic/underline/inverse/strike, 8 + bright + 256 +
truecolor, resets), `\r` in-line overwrite, `\b`, tab expansion, and `CSI K`
erase — which is what actually collapses a progress bar (a bare `\r` leaves
the tail, on a real tty too). OSC 8 hyperlinks drop the URI and the sequence
but keep the linked words — a hyperlink wraps visible text, and losing the
words would make the log lie. Everything else — cursor addressing, scroll
regions, alternate screen, window-title OSC — is **discarded**, never printed.

### Not a PTY

The child is connected to **pipes**, not a pseudo-terminal. `isatty` is false,
so many programs disable colour and switch to line buffering; full-screen
programs (`vim`, `top`) do not work; there is no terminal size and no
SIGWINCH. The declared environment sets `TERM=dumb` rather than lying about
it.

`kuro.ansi` is a line-oriented reader, not a screen emulator — it has no
cursor grid and no scrollback. A real PTY needs a native addon (node-pty or
equivalent), which is a dependency decision this repo has not taken.

## A browser backing — `kuro.fs` + `kuro.host.stream-browser`

In a browser there is no process to spawn and no disk — so the host seam is
filled differently, and the receipts say so.

### `kuro.fs` — a filesystem whose substrate is a CID DAG

`kuro.fs` is portable `.cljc` (the same source runs on the JVM, under nbb,
and in a browser via the shadow-cljs build). Paths map onto a content-
addressed DAG: a directory is an IPLD map block, a file is a unixfs file
DAG (`tech-ipfs-specs-unixfs` — not re-implemented here). The host injects
two effects:

    put-block : bytes -> cid
    get-block : cid -> bytes | nil

The production wiring is an OPFS-backed cache in front of the kotobase
gateway (`kuro.host.opfs`); tests use an in-memory atom. Writes are
immutable — every write produces a new root, so undo is remembering a
previous root. Denied work (path traversal, missing paths, non-empty-dir
removal) produces recorded receipts, not exceptions — an empty receipt list
must not mean both refused and never asked.

### `kuro.host.opfs` — the block store Worker

A dedicated Worker holds OPFS sync access handles (a Worker-only API) and
speaks a closed op vocabulary (`put` / `get` / `delete` / `publish` /
`stats` / `drop-cache`). CIDs are minted with WebCrypto sha-256 inside the
Worker; the math is parity-locked with `kuro.host.cid` (node:crypto) and an
independent Python mint. `publish` verifies each block's bytes hash to its
claimed CID before counting it. OPFS is origin-scoped **cache** — durable
custody is kotobase (`PUT/GET kotobase.net/ipld/:cid`), and publish is an
explicit op, never automatic.

### `kuro.host.stream-browser` — terminal host over a guest component

The `stream-node` shape (start / write / kill / on-chunk / on-exit) with a
guest-component backing instead of a spawned process. Commands are guest
invocation specs (guest CID + export + args); **argv vectors are denied with
`:argv-not-a-process`** — a browser has no processes, and a receipt that
pretended otherwise would lie about what ran.

### Isolation, on the record

Every browser-host receipt carries `:kuro/isolation :browser-origin`, which
records: ran in a Worker, no DOM, no ambient authority, effects only through
capability-gated host imports. It does **not** claim kernel-level
sandboxing — a capability set is an intent record, not a kernel (same rule
as above). The gate is real where it can be: the host refuses to satisfy a
guest's `fs_read` import unless the grant covers it, and fs/write implies
nothing about fs/read (separate leaves).

### Verified end-to-end

- real OPFS round-trip with WebCrypto-minted CIDs (byte-identical across
  node:crypto, WebCrypto-in-Worker, and an independent Python mint)
- a real WASM guest (assembled with wasm-tools) streaming its output into
  `kuro.stream` and finishing with an isolated receipt
- `kuro.fs` itself running in the browser (shadow-cljs build) writing,
  listing, and reading back byte-identical through the OPFS store
- a guest reading a `kuro.fs`-written file through a gated `fs_read` import,
  with the un-granted capability refused

See `test/browser/verify_*.cljs` and ADR-2609041240.

## Tests

```sh
clojure -M:test                     # portable model + ansi + stream (JVM)
npm install
npm run test:parity                 # the SAME .cljc suites under ClojureScript
npm run test:host                   # both Node host providers (nbb)
```

All three run in CI.

`test:parity` exists because "portable `.cljc`" was a claim nobody checked. For
one day `kuro.ansi` was green on the JVM and **silently produced no output at
all under ClojureScript** — `(int c)` is `NaN` there, so the CSI scanner never
found a final byte and discarded everything. The consumer that broke was
`kobo`'s server, which runs on nbb. A `.cljc` namespace tested on one runtime
can be entirely dead on the other.
