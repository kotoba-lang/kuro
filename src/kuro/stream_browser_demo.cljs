(ns kuro.stream-browser-demo
  "Browser entry for the kuro.host.stream-browser E2E (issue #63 step 2).

  Earlier, the stream-browser E2E drove the kuro.stream wire contract by
  hand inside the page — the guest was instantiated in the page itself, its
  memory read there, and results.streamChunks assembled by hand. That proved
  a WASM module can run in Chromium, but NOT that kuro.host.stream-browser
  produces the isolated receipt the README claims: the host (the thing that
  turns worker chunk/exit messages into a kuro.stream receipt) was never in
  the path.

  This namespace is the piece that makes the claim real. It calls the REAL
  kuro.host.stream-browser/start, makes it drive the REAL kuro-stream-worker.js
  (src/kuro/host/stream_worker.js), and surfaces the resulting chunks and
  exit receipt. It is compiled by shadow-cljs into the fs-browser build's
  stream-browser module and loaded by test/browser/verify_stream_browser.cljs.

  Exposes window.streamBrowserE2E(guestSpecJson) -> Promise<result>."
