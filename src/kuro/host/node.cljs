(ns kuro.host.node
  "Node host provider for `:terminal-repo` / `:terminal-build` / `:terminal-agent`
  sessions. This is the layer `kuro.terminal`'s docstrings keep pointing at:
  the model decides *whether* a command may run and *what the receipt says*;
  this namespace is the only place that actually runs one.

  ## Runtime

  ClojureScript on Node (nbb), per the repo runtime order — the pure model
  stays `.cljc`, the effect lands in the highest runtime that can spawn a
  process. Nothing here is required to use `kuro.terminal`.

  ## What is actually enforced (deterministic, tested)

  | guarantee | mechanism |
  |---|---|
  | denial before execution | `kuro.terminal/denial` — no spawn happens on a missing capability |
  | no shell interpolation | `spawnSync` with an argv vector and `:shell false` |
  | cwd confinement | resolved path must stay under the session's repo root |
  | no ambient environment | the child env is exactly the declared manifest; `process.env` is never passed |
  | bounded time | `:timeout-ms` (default 120 s) — exit 124, `:timed-out? true` |
  | bounded output | `:max-output-bytes` (default 1 MiB) — exit 125, `:truncated? true` |
  | content-addressed output | stdout/stderr CIDv1-raw in the receipt |

  ## What is NOT enforced here (say it plainly)

  A capability set is an **intent record**, not a kernel. This provider does
  not confine filesystem writes, does not block network access, and does not
  isolate the process namespace. A command granted `repo/read` can still write
  to disk — nothing stops it but the receipt that says it should not have.

  That is the documented split: ADR-2606301000 says the backing may be a
  sandbox, container, microVM, or an aiueos surface provider, and `kuro` only
  records the intent and verifies the portable shape. This is the smallest
  honest backing — enough to produce real receipts from real commands, not
  enough to run untrusted code. `:terminal-host` is refused outright."

  One caveat, measured rather than assumed: on macOS, CoreFoundation injects
  `__CF_USER_TEXT_ENCODING` into every child below the spawn API. The manifest
