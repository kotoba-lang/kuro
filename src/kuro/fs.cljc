(ns kuro.fs
  "Browser-resident filesystem model: a POSIX-flavoured path API whose storage
  substrate is a content-addressed IPLD DAG (ADR-2609041240).

  ## Why this namespace is pure

  Like `kuro.terminal`, this file has no I/O, no clock, no crypto, no globals.
  The host (OPFS-backed cache, kotobase gateway, browser Worker) supplies:

    - `put-block`  : bytes -> cid          (host computes sha256 + CID)
    - `get-block`  : cid -> bytes | nil    (cache -> gateway order)
    - `now-ms`     : optional receipt timestamps

  This namespace only maps **paths to DAGs** and records **receipts**. That
  split is what lets the same model run against an in-memory block store in
  tests, OPFS in a Worker, and kotobase.net in production — the substrate is
  the host's choice, the semantics are here.

  ## The mapping (the one decision in this namespace)

    - a **directory** is an IPLD map block: entries are name -> child CID,
      values are bytes, so a directory with no children is still one
      deterministic block.
    - a **file** is a unixfs file DAG (`tech-ipfs-specs-unixfs`): one chunk is
      a bare raw block, more is a dag-pb tree. We do not re-implement the
      chunker — the host wires `unixfs.file/build` and `read-file`.
    - **every write produces a new root CID.** There is no in-place mutation;
      `write` is `(fs/write store path bytes)` -> new store value. Undo is
      therefore just remembering a previous root.
    - **receipts, not exceptions, for denied work.** A path that escapes the
      mount root, a write without `fs/write` capability, a read of a
      non-existent path — each returns a `:kuro.fs/denied` receipt. An empty
      receipt list must not mean both refused and never asked (the same
      rule `kobo.workbench` records for denials).

  ## Receipts are fixed-shape, namespaced

  Mirroring `kuro.terminal/receipt`: host- or caller-supplied extras are
  dropped, everything lands in `:kuro.fs/*`."
