;; Registration guard (issue #99).
;;
;; nbb's SCI analyzer (1.4.208, the version this repo pins) can SILENTLY fail
;; to compile some `deftest` forms: the var is interned but bound to a
;; placeholder with NO `:test` meta, so `cljs.test` never runs it and the
;; suite reports green anyway. Measured: `kuro.host.stream-node-test` is
;; 4/29 — 25 tests (including the #96/#97/#98 guards) loaded but never ran,
;; and CI has been green the whole time. This is the exact failure class
;; CLAUDE.md warns about ("緑だった側は誰も使わず"). `cljs.test` has no way to
;; know a deftest was dropped, so the runner asserts the registered `:test`
;; deftest count equals the source count and exits nonzero on a gap.
;;
;; Root cause (Sept 2026): a stray paren in the stream-node test file nested
;; deftests #3-#27 inside deftest #2, so they were never top-level forms - NOT
;; an nbb version bug (the drop persists across nbb 1.4.208 and 1.5.212). This
;; guard is the permanent watchdog that turns any silent test-drop into a hard,
;; named CI failure regardless of cause.

;; Namespace drift guard — the host-side mirror of run_parity_tests.cljs's
;; `assert-model-namespaces-in-sync!` (#102). The parity runner got a guard
;; that refuses to drift between the namespaces it lists and the `.cljc` model
;; test files under test/kuro/; the host runner only protects against a
;; *dropped deftest* (the count map above), not against a whole dropped file.
;;
;; A new `test/kuro/host/*_test.cljs` that is forgotten here would run on
;; NEITHER JVM (which only auto-discovers `.cljc` model tests, not `.cljs` host
;; tests) NOR nbb — a test that never runs on any runtime while the gates stay
;; green. That is the same silent-half-green failure class CLAUDE.md names
;; (2026-08-03: kuro.ansi green on JVM, never run where the consumer lives).
;; This guard turns "added a host test file and forgot to wire it up" into a
;; hard, named CI failure.
