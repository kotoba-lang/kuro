;; README (kuro.host.opfs section) claims the CID math is parity-locked
;; against "an independent Python mint" (scripts/cid_mint.py), and that the
;; three mints — node:crypto, WebCrypto-in-Worker, the Python mint — are
;; byte-identical for the same bytes. That claim previously told a story with
;; nothing running it: no .py file, no CI step, no pin. This test makes it a
;; claim that RUNS: it spawns the independent Python mint on the same vectors
;; the cljs mint is pinned against, and requires both to agree.
;;
;; Comparison path matters: `cid/sha256-raw-cid` is the FRAMING layer — it
;; expects a pre-hashed 32-byte digest (what the Worker's WebCrypto hands it)
;; and does NOT hash its own input. The full hash-to-CID path is
;; `cid/text-cid` (node:crypto sha-256 over the UTF-8 bytes, then frame) —
;; exactly what `kuro.host.stream-node` mints for stdout/stderr receipts. So
;; this test pins `text-cid` (the real mint) against the independent Python
;; mint, which also hashes. Pinning `sha256-raw-cid` on raw non-digest bytes
;; would only prove two framings of the same misguided bytes agree — not that
;; the CID equals the hash of the content.
